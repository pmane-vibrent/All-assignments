Create a spring boot application. The application should have following

3 REST Endpoints (GET, POST, DELETE)

GET Endpoint should take 2 query parameters (one required and one non required, validate them and return a dummy response)

POST Endpoint should take an object of User class as request body, validate it and return a dummy response

DELETE Endpoint should take in a single required query parameter and return a dummy response.

All the 3 endpoints should have some specific hardcoded cases where they return different HTTP Errors (For example if param had value 111 then send INTERNAL SERVER ERROR etc
