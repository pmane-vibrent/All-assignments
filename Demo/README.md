There is an online Exercise system<br>

It has 3 types of exercises  

Walking, Cycling, Running

System should be flexible to enhance to accommodate any type of exercise in the future.  

Given an exercise for a user, System should print the calories burned for that exercise. 

For e.g.

Input :

User - Philip

Exercise Type - Walking

Duration - 30 min

Date : (If not provided, default to current date else date in mm-dd-yyyy format)

Output : 

n calories

Use any formula to calculate the calories. 

<br> 

System also should support aggregated mode as well as detailed mode. 

For e.g. If there are multiple exercises for the same user on same day, system should print the sum of calories burned in aggregated mode. In detail mode, it should print all the exercise details. 

By default it should print exercise details in Aggregate mode and the order should be sorted by User, Date, Exercise Type
